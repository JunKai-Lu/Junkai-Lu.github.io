<h3>Welcome to My Website! </h3>

This is my personal website.

My name is **JUNKAI LU（卢俊楷）**, and I live in **Fuzhou（福州）** city, China now. I serve as a game AI engineer in a startup game company in Fuzhou, where my major work is design and implement high-performance game AI agent as powerful as possible under limited computational budget. In the other words, I offer and implement solutions for AI in games, in particular board and card games.

Game AI is the main area that I dedicate for. I have some relative research paper for this area which were published during my universty life, they can be found in Publication page. Beyond those publications of game AI, another contribution of mine is I created some open-source library for game AI community, they can be found in my GitHub page, or you can see the Projects page of this site to acquire them, I introduced those library there.

There are also some other projects that I am doing such as the transation work of a new game AI textbook, you can find their details and current progress in the Projects page.

If you have any question about my work, you can contact me via Contact page or send email to [junkai-lu@outlook.com](junkai-lu@outlook.com "junkai-lu@outlook.com") directly. I would reply you as soon as possible.
