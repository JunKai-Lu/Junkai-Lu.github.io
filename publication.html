<h3>My Publications</h3>

<p align="justify">I have some publications that are relative to game AI, they were published when I was a junior student in university, so I have to say those articles are not enough good in my current perspective. They were wrote by chinese at first, then were translated to english. If you have interest about those publications, they can be viewed by <a href="ieeexplore.ieee.org">IEEE Xplore</a> or some other database that contains them. If possible, I hope to create better articles in the future time, and I would update this page if there is any new publication.</p>
